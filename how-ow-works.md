# How Overwatch Works

There are a several factors that can impede or propel your journey through the world of Overwatch. This  some fundemental things at a high level, things that I don't think will ever change about Overwatch. I'm not exactly sure what audience this is written for, but I can only hope it makes the OW experience better for someone or encourages useful discussion

## General Knowledge
...is the stuff you know about the game, *generally*, that helps you win, like:

- How hero abilities work and interact
    - Can I heal through that shield?
- Which heroes are effective against which other heroes
- Map specific tricks and tactics
- Terminology, so you can talk about the game
- Concepts like you might find in this guide

## Attention Management
Human beings don't really "multitask". Your attention is a resource and in a fast paced game like OW, you have to be careful what you do with it. Putting all your attention onto tracking that low health enemy with your cursor when dangers are presenting themselves elsewhere will get you or your team killed frequently. Arguing in the voice channel about team composition while your teammates get gunned down and your abilities go unused will, too. It's important to shift your focus around and not neglect any one aspect of the game.

### MECHANICS
Can you track targets with your crosshair? Can you click on faces good? Did you use Mei's ice block in time to save your own life? Can you arc a junkrat bomb over a wall onto someones head, and other tricky stuff like that? I find that I do the best mechanically when I'm most *focused* on my mechanics, which can also mean I'm not being observant or communicative. Mechanical skill can vary significantly between players, but you can make up for it in other areas --and not all heroes demand high mechanical skill.

### OBSERVATION
Good "game sense" means means having accurate, up to date information in mind so you can make the right decisions to create the most value for your team. There are a lot of things to keep track of and it's impossible to keep track of all of them continuously. Observation is an action like any other that takes some amount of attention, even if it's just looking at the corner of the screen to see the kill feed.

Here a few categories, with some specific questions you might seek to answer.

- Team compositions
    - Does ours play well to theirs?
    - Do we work well on this map?
- Self Health/Armor/Ammo/Cooldowns:
    - Is it time to back off?
    - Will my ability be ready in time?
    - Do I have enough ammo to engage and win?
- Ally Position & Status: 
    - Where are my teammates? Are they bubbled, slept or trapped?
    - Are any dead? Can they get here in time to back me up?
    - Are we making a play that I should help with?
    - Is this a safe and/or effective place for me/us to be?
- Enemy Position & Status: 
    - What threats am I facing? 
    - What threats are my teammates facing?
    - Is anyone "out of position", i.e. an easy target?
    - Is anyone doing something I should communicate to my team? 
- Ultimate Economy: 
    - What ultimates do my team have ready?
    - How soon will others be ready?
    - What enemy ultimates might come soon?
- Meta Stuff:
    - Who am I playing with? What are their strengths and weaknesses?

### COMMUNICATION
Communication is another area where you have to strike a balance in terms of attention. Talking demands attention from you and your team, but not communicating at all will inevitably lead to underinformed decision-making and lost fights. Character
Good communication is:
- Terse & Unambiguous: Your teammates will quickly understand your point
- Relevent: You aren't distracting your team with memes, or telling them things that aren't helpful
- Inoffensive: Angry teammates harm your chances of winning like almost nothing else

Using the character voice communication features to their fullest can provide a lot of value, too.

## Cooperation
Cooperation is essential to high level play, because it's essential to maximizing 

### ATTACK TIMING SYNCHRONIZATION
In Starcraft, a dozen marines in a tight cluster can take out a much larger number of marines that are spread apart. The grouped marines will spend a lot more time firing their weapons and dealing damage in aggregate, because they quickly win each encounter together with their high combined damage-per-second. 

This is the same dynamic that makes a "trickling" team a bad thing in OW. Running A team that groups better, all else being equal, will have a relative advantage in damage and eliminations. Better synchronization leads to better results.

time spent visible, in range, and vulnerable to enemy weapons and abilities


### TARGET SYNCHRONIZATION
It's *almost* always better for your team to focus the same target in order to get an elimination sooner, than to delay it by spreading damage around to multiple targets. 

### COMPLEMENTARY ABILITIES
There's a lot of synergy between some heroes. Halt and hook, Graviton and anything, Mercy's M2 and Pharah's M1... There are too many good pairings to list.

### SPLITTING FOCUS
Since we know it's valuable to synchronize, it must be valuable to prevent cooperation by the enemies, too.

## Prediction and Unpredictability
Being able to predict your enemies behavior is an advantage in planning your next move. Likewise, being unpredictable takes an advantage away from your enemies.
